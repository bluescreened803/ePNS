# ePNS
**Note: This is not intended to be used in a production environment.**
<br /> ePNS aims to create a mesh network of raspberry piâ€™s that can be deployed (via drones or people) in a disaster area to establish communication between the people and the authorities. Each raspberry pi node will broadcast a WIFI network that the user can connect to via their mobile device. Upon connecting to the WIFI network the user will be able to access a portal in which they may alert authorities of their current situation (e.g., if they need first aid, food and find the latest information). The authorities can then view this data and use it to formulate an action plan and locate people they otherwise may be unaware of.
