# ePNS Project Summary

### Project Aim

---

Create a mesh network of Raspberry Piâ€™s that can be deployed (via drones or people) in a disaster area to establish communication between the people and the authorities. Each raspberry pi node will broadcast a WIFI network that the user can connect to via their mobile device. Upon connecting to the WIFI network the user will be able to access a portal in which they may alert authorities of their current situation (e.g. if they need first aid, food) and find the latest information. The authorities can then view this data and use it to formulate an action plan and locate people they otherwise may be unaware of.

### Expansion of the Project

---

Our project thrives in the innovation of new ideas. It is easily expandable, and during these difficult time, this can be a low cost method in bringing information to people across our country, with wellbeing forms and COVID information. This can also be functional as a efficient system for people to gain support from chat advisors. To improve security, using encrypted packets will benefit the privacy of all people that use this system. To improve wireless signal range, we could use LoRa instead of WIFI. With this ad hoc system, you can create what you want and we enable developers to expand, adding more Pi more complex tasks.
